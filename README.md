NOTES: 
* For those interested in the data from the CGP-RL and Node CGP-RL experiments, they are in the Results folder instead of the cgp-rl data and node cgp-rl data folders.
* The algorithms in this repository are a variation of Cartesian Genetic Programming and the implementation was based on the implementation presented here: https://github.com/ciml/ciml-lib/tree/applied-soft-computing-2019
