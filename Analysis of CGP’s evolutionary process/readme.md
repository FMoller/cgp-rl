In order to better understand how mutation in a node element impacts CGP, we analyzed the frequency with which the mutation in each element increases the quality of the current solution throughout the evolutionary process. The study was done on the problems labeled small in [@benchmark], using SAM mutation, with 25 independent runs per problem. Each occurrence of improvement was grouped by an arbitrarily chosen interval that represents 4-percentile of the budget and the data is show in plots in Figures \ref{fig:2}, \ref{fig:3} and \ref{fig:4}.
