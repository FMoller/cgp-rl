abstract="The design of digital logic circuits involves transforming logical expressions into an electronic circuit seeking to minimize certain attributes such as the number of transistors. There are deterministic algorithms for this task, but they are limited to small problems. On the other hand metaheuristics can be used for solving this type of problem and Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) is widely adopted in the literature. In CGP, mutation is commonly the only operator for generating new candidate solutions. Thus, the performance of this metaheuristic is dependent on the proper choice of mutation and its parameters. Normally, CGP mutates the candidate solutions according to a uniform distribution. Thus, any modification has the same chance to occur. In order to improve the performance of CGP an adaptive mutation operator using an {\$}{\$}{\backslash}epsilon {\$}{\$}-greedy strategy for bias the selection of gates is proposed here. The proposal is evaluated using problems of a benchmark from the literature. The results obtained indicate that the proposed adaptive mutation is promising and that its relative performance increases with the size of the problem.",

abstract="The design of digital circuits has been widely investigated in the literature but the evolution of complex combinational logic circuits is not an easy task for Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). We propose here a new approach in order to increase the capacity of CGP in finding feasible circuits (those with the same response of the truth table). The proposed procedure uses a 3-step evolution by coupling a 2-input multiplexer in each circuit's output. These multiplexers divide the truth table and the similarity between its inputs is maximized. Thus, don't-care situations are generated for the controls of the multiplexers, making the evolution of CGP easier. Also, a variant of the standard evolutionary strategy commonly adopted in CGP is proposed, where the following procedures are considered: (i) the Single Active Mutation (SAM), (ii) the Guided Active Mutation (GAM), and (iii) a crossover. The proposed methods are applied to combinational logic circuits with multiple outputs and the results obtained are compared to those found by a standard CGP with SAM. Benchmark problems with inputs from 9 to 12 are used in the computational experiments, and the objective is to find circuits that match the truth tables. The results show that (i) the combination of crossover, SAM, and GAM increases the performance of CGP, and (ii) the proposed 3-step method is the only technique tested here able to obtain feasible solutions in all independent runs.",
